			If you are using armor from Low Tech, you should change to the "Humanoid - Low Tech" body in the Body & Locations tab of the Protection dialog. If you make that change for the All Unassigned Items loadout, then future loadouts that you create will default to that body._

#Log blue "Low-tech armor from the Basic Set is incompatible with Low Tech and has been removed."
#Log red "If you are using armor from Low Tech, you should change to the "Humanoid - Low Tech" body in the Body & Locations tab of the Protection dialog. If you make that change for the All Unassigned Items loadout, then future loadouts that you create will default to that body."
