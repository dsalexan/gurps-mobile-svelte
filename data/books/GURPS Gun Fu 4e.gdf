You must specialize by shooting skill. Your basic Parry is (shooting skill/2) + 3. Modifiers: -15 for the small target and short time window; +1 for Combat Reflexes or +6 for Enhanced Time Sense; Enhanced Parry (Area Defense), if the GM permits that advantage; full Accuracy, regardless of weapon, if you have Gunslinger; any rapid-fire bonus (you may fire up to your gun's RoF). Any success stops the projectile. Any failure doesn't! This perk is highly cinematic – don't sweat details like where misses go or the target's exact SM and speed. However, the GM is free to make rockets and missiles (rather than bullets, daggers, or arrows) easier to hit, or to limit this perk to such targets only.),_

When wielding a heavy weapon with any Artillery or Gunner skill – or with the GL, LAW, or LMG specialty of Guns – you may ignore any † (two-handed) or M (mounted) note on its ST, and all extra crew requirements, as long as you meet the ST listed for it in the table. This lets you use it one-handed, sans loaders or assistants.)
Bank shot (%Gun Skill%), 1, cat(Gun Perks), page(GF17), needs(SK:%Gun SkillList%, AD:Gunslinger), description(You can ricochet bullets off surfaces to hit a target behind a hostage, around a corner, etc. The DR and HP of the things you're bouncing shots off aren't important – what matters is that these objects are convincingly hard. Roll to hit as usual, using the full range along the indirect path to the target, and add -2 per ricochet. You must specialize by shooting skill.),_

Cinematic Knockback, 1, page(HT249, GF17), needs(AD:Gunslinger), Description(If the campaign doesn't generally use Cinematic Knockback (p. B417), being able to produce that effect is a perk. Note that movies are the only place you'll see this perk in action, because it's totally unrealistic! Even large-caliber rifles and autocannon can't push around a human. The "knockback" some people claim to have witnessed is the victim jumping in surprise or staggering from injuries. You must specialize by shooting skill. Not just any gun will do, though! The weaponmust be covered by your specialty and suitably imposing: a 12-gauge, not a runty .410; a .44Magnum, not a dinky .22.), cat(Gun Perks),_

Cinematic Option, 1, page(HT249, GF17), needs(AD:Gunslinger), Description(The alternatives described under Cinematic Combat Rules (p. B417) generally don't cost points because they're campaign options: Everybody uses them or nobody does. The GM may wish to allow certain rules that normally aren't used in the campaign on a PC-by-PC basis, however. Access to each of these is a perk. Suitable choices for individual character abilities are Bulletproof Nudity, Cinematic Knockback, Flesh Wounds, Infinite Ammunition, and TV Action Violence. The GM should require specialization by skill for perks that modify attacks; e.g., Cinematic Knockback. For detailed examples, see Cinematic Knockback (above) and Infinite Ammunition (p. 19-20). However, any perk marked ‡ could work this way.), cat(Gun Perks),_

Cinematic Option (Bulletproof Nudity), 1, page(417, GF17), cat(Gun Perks), description(The alternatives described under Cinematic Combat Rules (p.

The GM may wish to allow certain rules that normally aren't used in the campaign on a PC-by-PC basis, however. Access to each of these is a perk. Suitable choices for individual character abilities are Bulletproof Nudity, Cinematic Knockback, Flesh Wounds, Infinite Ammunition, and TV Action Violence. The GM should require specialization by skill for perks that modify attacks; e.g., Cinematic Knockback. For detailed examples, see Cinematic Knockback (above) and Infinite Ammunition (p. 19-20). However, any perk marked ‡ could work this way. PCs with Attractive or better appearance can get a bonus to active defenses simply by undressing! Any outfit that bares legs, chest, or midriff is +1. Just a loincloth or skimpy swimwear is +2. Topless females get an extra +1. Total nudity gives no further bonus to defense, but adds +1 to Move and +2 water Move.)
Cinematic Option (TV Action Violence), 1, page(417, GF17), cat(Gun Perks), description(The alternatives described under Cinematic Combat Rules (p. B417) generally don't cost points because they're campaign options: Everybody uses them or nobody does. The GM may wish to allow certain rules that normally aren't used in the campaign on a PC-by-PC basis, however. Access to each of these is a perk.

The GM should require specialization by skill for perks that modify attacks; e.g., Cinematic Knockback. For detailed examples, see Cinematic Knockback (above) and Infinite Ammunition (p. 19-20). However, any perk marked ‡ could work this way. If struck by a potentially lethal attack (including a rapid-fire attack that inflicts multiple hits), the hero can choose to convert his failed defense roll into a success. This costs him 1 FP and he loses his next turn. The hero cannot spend FP to avoid unarmed attacks or melee or thrown weapon attacks that inflict crushing damage (or no damage, such as a grapple), unless they would hit the skull or neck. Likewise, he cannot avert attacks on his weapons or nonliving possessions. With this rule in effect, those involved in a fight with lethal weapons "duck for cover" and are forced "onto the defensive" until they're exhausted.)
Cinematic Option (Cinematic Explosions), 1, page(417, GF17), cat(Gun Perks), description(The alternatives described under Cinematic Combat Rules (p. B417) generally don't cost points because they're campaign options: Everybody uses them or nobody does. The GM may wish to allow certain rules that normally aren't used in the campaign on a PC-by-PC basis, however. Access to each of these is a perk. Suitable choices for individual character abilities are Bulletproof Nudity, Cinematic Knockback, Flesh Wounds, Infinite Ammunition, and TV Action Violence. The GM should require specialization by skill for perks that modify attacks; e.g., Cinematic Knockback. For detailed examples, see Cinematic Knockback (above) and Infinite Ammunition (p. 19-20). However, any perk marked ‡ could work this way. In reality, a grenade or anti-tank rocket will almost certainly kill an unarmored man. In cinematic combat, explosions do no direct damage! Ignore fragmentation, too. All a blast does is disarray clothing, blacken faces, and (most importantly) cause knockback. Every yard of knockback from a cinematic explosion causes a token 1 HP of crushing damage.)
Cinematic Option (Flesh Wounds), 1, page(417, GF17), cat(Gun Perks), description(The alternatives described under Cinematic Combat Rules (p. B417) generally don't cost points because they're campaign options: Everybody uses them or nobody does. The GM may wish to allow certain rules that normally aren't used in the campaign on a PC-by-PC basis, however. Access to each of these is a perk. Suitable choices for individual character abilities are Bulletproof Nudity, Cinematic Knockback, Flesh Wounds, Infinite Ammunition, and TV Action Violence. The GM should require specialization by skill for perks that modify attacks; e.g., Cinematic Knockback. For detailed examples, see Cinematic Knockback (above) and Infinite Ammunition (p. 19-20). However, any perk marked ‡ could work this way. Immediately after you suffer damage, you may declare that the attack that damaged you (which can include multiple hits, if the foe used rapid fire) was a glancing blow or "just a flesh wound." This lets you ignore all but 1 HP (or FP) of damage . . . at the cost of one unspent character point. If you have no unspent points, the GM might let you go into "debt": he will subtract these points from those you earn for the adventure.)
Cinematic Option (Melee Etiquette), 1, page(417, GF17), cat(Gun Perks), description(The alternatives described under Cinematic Combat Rules (p. B417) generally don't cost points because they're campaign options: Everybody uses them or nobody does. The GM may wish to allow certain rules that normally aren't used in the campaign on a PC-by-PC basis, however. Access to each of these is a perk. Suitable choices for individual character abilities are Bulletproof Nudity, Cinematic Knockback, Flesh Wounds, Infinite Ammunition, and TV Action Violence. The GM should require specialization by skill for perks that modify attacks; e.g., Cinematic Knockback. For detailed examples, see Cinematic Knockback (above) and Infinite Ammunition (p. 19-20). However, any perk marked ‡ could work this way. If a PC chooses to fight unarmed or with melee weapons, his opponents always face him one-on-one, one at a time. Unengaged NPCs can dance around the fight uttering shrill cries of encouragement, but wait their turn to attack. If the foe is a super-strong monster that could kill or maim the hero with a single blow, it rarely strikes to inflict damage directly. Instead it slams the hero, or grabs him and tosses him around!)
Concealed Carry Permit, 1, page(GF17), cat(Gun Perks), description(In Gun Fu campaigns that pay lip service to legal niceties, it's usually illegal to carry concealed firearms without suitable Legal Enforcement Powers and/or Rank. People who lack those advantages need a permit for this, which counts as a perk. Optionally, action-movie cops who have Legal Enforcement Powers can obtain a "Heavy Weapons Permit" perk to legitimize assault weapons and explosives for police work!)

Cookie Cutter (%Gun Skill%), 1, cat(Gun Perks), page(GF17), needs(SK:%Gun SkillList%, AD:Gunslinger), description(You can use a full-automatic weapon (optionally, even a shotgun!) to cut holes through walls, floors, and ceilings – like a jigsaw through plywood. Each magazine emptied creates an opening big enough to admit one SM 0 person (or two people clinging to each other). You must specialize by shooting skill. The weapon matters less and need not be one that could actually chew through the target's DR or HP. In the movies, this perk works fine with everything from 9mm machine pistols to powerful science-fiction assault rifles. Cookie Cutter only allows dramatic exits and entries, though. You can't use it to bypass armor or the plot – no destroying vault doors in crime stories!),_

Cool Under Fire, 1, page(GF18), cat(Gun Perks), description(You don't experience "tunnel vision" under fire and can quickly update your mental picture of the battlefield. When making pop-up attacks (p. B390), you don't suffer the -2 to hit provided that the target is no further away in yards than your Per plus Acute Vision (if any). This perk is redundant if you have Enhanced Time Sense or Gunslinger.)
Cross-Trained, 1, page(HT249, GF18), cat(Gun Perks), needs(AD:Trained by a Master | AD:Gunslinger), description(You're familiar with every make and model of gun within a particular shooting skill specialty. You can pick up any such weapon and fire it with no unfamiliarity penalty (see p. B169). If the Gun! or Shooter! wildcard skill (p. 24) is used in the campaign, this perk becomes superfluous – if you are capable of using all Guns specialties, there's no need for familiarity with specific makes and models . . . This perk is cinematic, but a version that covers a large-but finite list is realistic for spies and soldiers who receive lavish training. The GM decides what constitutes such training and which models it covers. Alternatively, the GM may see familiarity as fussy and ignore it; in effect, everybody is Cross-Trained for free.),_
	x(#InputToTagReplace("Choose your gun specialization: Pistol, Rifle, etc." , nameext, ,"Cross-Trained"))
Deadeye, 1/2, upto(3), page(GF18), cat(Gun Perks), description(You're a natural sniper. You can accurately gauge range, windage, thermal effects, and so on, allowing you to attempt Precision Aiming (p. 12) without special equipment. Since you aren't fooling with ballistics tables, spotting scopes, etc., you may reduce the total time required to claim your Precision Aiming bonus by 10% (round up) after all other calculations. You may buy this perk several times; each level improves your margin by 10% (to a maximum of Deadeye 3, with a 30% reduction).)
Dial-a-Round (%Gun Skill%), 1, cat(Gun Perks), page(GF17), needs(SK:%Gun SkillList%, AD:Gunslinger), description(If you use a weapon loaded with two ormore different types of projectiles, you can always fire a type of your choice, as long as there's still one remaining in the weapon. This is entirely cinematic, of course, as there's no way the cartridges can rearrange the order in which they are loaded! For extra fun, the GM can demand that, similar to a cinematic martial artist announcing the name of his next maneuver, the PC has to shout out loud which round he's going to shoot! You must specialize by shooting skill.),_

Dramatic Death, 1, page(GF18), cat(Gun Perks), needs(AD:Gunslinger), description(You're guaranteed to go out with a bang! If the dice sentence you to death but not to instant death (like an execution or a nuclear blast), roll 1d+1 for the number of seconds you get for a dying action (see Dying Actions, p. B423). During this time, you suffer all injury effects except unconsciousness or death, but you can otherwise do whatever you want. Then you die.)
Dual Ready, 1, page(HT249, GF18), needs(AD:Gunslinger), Description(You can use one Ready maneuver to draw two items, one in either hand. Specialize by particular left hand/right hand combination; e.g., Dual Ready (Detonator/Bomb) lets you ready an explosive in your right hand and its radio control in your left hand. Dual Ready is redundant for items you can Fast-Draw – but not everything allows Fast-Draw.), cat(Gun Perks),_
	x(#InputToTagReplace("Please specialize: LEFT HAND/RIGHT HAND" , nameext, ,"Dual Ready"))
Early Adopter, 1, page(HT249, GF18), Description(You have access to firearms that haven't entered production (see High-Tech and similar sources for introduction dates). In a more realistic campaign, this means prototypes; the GM may limit you to guns a year or two down the road. In a cinematic game, if even one weapon of a given type (e.g., "belt-fed machine guns") already exists, you can have any gun like that from your TL! You must pay for this hardware with starting money – or, more likely, as Signature Gear. Each broad category of weapons has its own specialty: Early Adopter (Pistols), Early Adopter (Rifles), etc.), cat(Gun Perks),_
	x(#InputToTagReplace("Please specialize. Ex. Pistols" , nameext, ,"Early Adopter"))
Fastest Gun in the West, 1/2, page(GF18), Description(Your fast-draw is really fast. In any Quick Contest of Fast-Draw to see who draws first, add 1 to your margin; e.g., failure by 1 becomes success by 0. This perk also gives you a chance to outdraw a rival who has Enhanced Time Sense: If you beat him by 10+ in the Quick Contest, or roll a critical success and he doesn't, you win! You may buy this perk several times. Each level improves your margin by 1. The GM sets the limit, if any – perhaps two levels in a realistic campaign. Specialties match those for Fast-Draw.),_
	x(#InputToTagReplace("Please specialize. Ex. Pistols, Submachine Gun, etc." , nameext, ,"Early Adopter"))
Fireball Shot, 1, page(GF19), cat(Gun Perks), needs(AD:Gunslinger), description(You're not limited to the meager effects of buckshot when firing a scattergun – your shotgun blasts actually explode! When shooting at inanimate targets (cars, ground, etc.), each shotshell round acts as a small grenade: Damage becomes 3d cr ex, RoF and Rcl are as for firing slugs, and other stats are unchanged. When shooting directly at people, your shells still deliver shot. This trait only suits over-the-top campaigns, but it is just a perk – you could achieve comparable results for 0 points by buying exotic ammo. It's inspired by action movies where heroes without military weapons can blow up things simply because it's dramatic.)
Flimsy Cover, 1, page(GF19), cat(Gun Perks), needs(AD:Gunslinger), description(They can't hit what they can't see! Whenever you take cover behind anything large enough to hide you, ignore Cover (p. B407) and Overpenetration (p. B408). Lampposts, trees, car doors, stacks of cardboard boxes, sofas, and the ever-popular overturned saloon table will shed enemy bullets like tank armor, regardless of DR and HP. This only works against small arms – and only while you hide. As soon as you expose yourself, the world works normally again.)
Grip Mastery, 1, cat(Style Perks - Realistic), page(MA50, GF19),_
	x(#InputToTagReplace("please enter the weapon you have Grip Mastery with:" , nameext, ,"Grip Mastery"))
Gun Sense, 1, page(GF19), cat(Gun Perks), needs(AD:Gunslinger), description(You have a sixth sense about guns pointed at you. You must specialize by shooting skill. Whenever somebody has you in the sights of a gun used with that skill and you can see him, make a Per-based skill roll. Success lets you know whether his gun is loaded and functional, or whether it's jammed, safetied, or otherwise can't shoot you. You can also use this perk to detect the status of a weapon carried by any ally within arm's reach.)
Gun Shtick - Next Time It's Your Head, 1, cat(Gun Perks), page(B101, MA51, GF19), needs(AD:Gunslinger), description(You're adept at intimidating rivals by shooting at their clothing or minor personal accessories. Make a standard attack at -2 or the penalty for the nearest body part, whichever is more severe. A hit does no damage, but lets you try Intimidation (p. B202) against that foe as a free action, at a bonus equal in size to half the attack penalty, rounded up. Some examples: Severing a belt or a necktie is a torso shot (no penalty), and gives -2 to hit and +1 to Intimidation. Cutting a cigar in half is a face hit, at -5 to hit and +3 to Intimidation. Shooting off a hat would be a skull attack, for -7 to hit and +4 to Intimidation. The GM may also assess your victim minor penalties for being without his belt, hat, etc.),_

Gun Shtick - Stone-Cold Killer, 1, cat(Gun Perks), page(B101, MA51, GF19), needs(AD:Gunslinger), description(Every shot you fire is an instrument of intimidation! You don't just shoot enemies – you blast them through windows, blow off their limbs, and produce fountains of gore. On any turn during which you shoot someone and inflict a wounding effect beyond mere injury – crippling, knockdown, death, etc. – make an immediate shooting skill roll. Success lets you try Intimidation against any witnesses as a free action.),_

Gun Shtick - Trick Reload, 1, cat(Gun Perks), page(B101, MA51, GF19), needs(AD:Gunslinger), description(You can reload a gun using a complicated trick. Describe this when you buy the perk; you might drop a magazine and kick it into the magazine well, or toss two shells into the open breech of a double-barreled shotgun. Your Fast-Draw (Ammo) roll doubles as an Influence roll (p. B359) for the purpose of impressing (not intimidating or asking help from) onlookers.),_

In the Old West, this was called the "Road Agent Spin." This perk is cinematic for any firearmbut a handgun (one-handed weapon with Bulk no worse than -3).),_

Gun Shtick - Wall o' Lead, 1, cat(Gun Perks), page(B101, MA51, GF19), needs(AD:Gunslinger), description(You know how to keep heads down by shooting up the scenery! On your turn, state that this is your goal and make any attack or series of attacks that your abilities allow. However, you don't wound those whom you "hit." Instead, make a group Intimidation attempt against everyone you would have hit. Apply the penalty for group size for the total number of foes fired on, but add the rapid-fire bonus for all shots fired. For instance, if you spray two RoF 10 machine pistols at 10 mooks and "hit" six men, you get -2 for trying to intimidate 10 people but you also get +4 for RoF 17-24, since your total RoF is 20!),_

You may buy this perk twice, for double the benefit, in a realistic campaign – or as many times as the GM is willing to allow in a cinematic game!

Infinite Ammunition (Over-the-Top Ammo), 1, page(GF19), taboo(PE:Infinite Ammunition (Quasi-Realistic Ammo)), cat(Gun Perks), needs(AD:Gunslinger), description(This version is the least realistic but also the most common: You truly have infinite ammo! You can go on shooting forever without reloading, and you have no need to carry or even pretend to carry ammunition, much less buy it or worry about it as encumbrance. Gunslingers inWesterns use this option: Every moviegoer knows why a "six-shooter" is called that, but most directors regard the painfully slow reload times for 19th-century weapons as a deadlier threat to drama than the jarring fiction of bottomless revolvers. Cheesy military action movies also use this variant – the worst B movies give even disposable antitank weapons multiple shots. The GM decides what version to use, and he may wish to make it a campaign option.)
Infinite Ammunition (Quasi-Realistic Ammo), 1, page(GF19), taboo(PE:Infinite Ammunition (Over-the-Top Ammo)), cat(Gun Perks), needs(AD:Gunslinger), description(This version adds a veneer of realism. You might carry spare ammo and reload during lulls in the shooting, but you never have to pause to reload in a gunfight. The GM may require you to pay for ammo and magazines – and perhaps limit you to thatmany shots total – but you can still ignore their encumbrance. For example, in Last Man Standing, gunman "John Smith" fills some two dozen magazines and frequently reloads his Colt .45s, but in action, he often fires more shots than the 16 rounds his two pistols could hold – and he doesn't seem to be carrying all those magazines! Those magazine-filling scenes, however, help the viewer suspend disbelief. The GM decides what version to use, and he may wish to make it a campaign option.)

Muzzle Flamethrower, 1, page(GF20), cat(Gun Perks), needs(AD:Gunslinger), description(When you fire a weapon for which you have bought the appropriate specialty of this perk, it will spew forth a yard-long flame from the muzzle. This gives a +2 bonus to Intimidation (p. B202). If you're in close combat (pp. B391-392), the attack also becomes incendiary (inc)! Others are at +3 Vision to spot you firing in the dark. In actual movie-making, this is the result of special blank loadings, which are used to make the guns look more impressive.

All of your equipment is either matte black or camouflage, and sports numerous after-market add-ons. Whenever you wield a weapon or wear armor that you've personally customized, you get a bonus to all Influence rolls and reaction rolls made in combat: +1 if you've added one to three custom accessories (a paint job counts as one), +2 for four to eight, +3 for nine to 15, and +4 for 16 or more. Useless accessories (like any of the Tacticool Gadgets, p. 42) count as two. This perk doesn't grantyou the accessories – you must buy those as usual! Example: Bubba Lee Jones has the Tacticool perk. He totes a Colt M4A1 carbine (High-Tech, p. 119) to which he has added a twin-drum magazine (High-Tech, p. 155), a reflex sight (High-Tech, p. 156), a night sight (High-Tech, p. 156), a tactical light (High-Tech, p. 156), a targeting laser (High-Tech, p. 156), and a set of accessory rails (High-Tech, p. 161) to actually mount all the stuff. That's six items, so he gets +2 to his Intimidation roll when he busts through the door with this baby – he calls her "Dita." You need only take this perk once, but you only get the single largest bonus for your most-accessorized item, no matter how much "tactical" gear you shlep. (In the example, Bubba would still get +2, not +4, if he brought along Dita's sexy twin, Rita, and held one in each hand.) This isn't tied to any specific item, but tweaked-out configurations are personal – the bonus isn't transferable if you lend your friends your kit, and another user's hardware never gives you a bonus.)

As you can't see the sights, you can't take Aim or All-Out Attack (Determined) maneuvers – only Attack or Move and Attack. Upside-Down Shooting is today more at home with cinematic shooters, but it was developed to deal with a specific tactical problem – that you have to draw your handgun from the belt or a cross-draw or hip holster with the off-hand (because the opposite hand is otherwise engaged or out of commission). In such a case, it is faster to use Upside-Down Shooting than to try to reverse the weapon first (the latter gives a -2 Fast-Draw penalty; the former gives no penalty). Don't forget to match this with Ambidexterity (p. 13) or Off-Hand Weapon Training (pp. 20-21), or you will also suffer the -4 penalty for using the off-hand.)

Double Trouble (Gun Fu), displaycost(5),_
	description(You walk in the footsteps of Miyamoto Musashi, with a deadly weapon in each hand. You have mastered techniques to create a deadly rhythm: "two drumsticks, one sound". Double Trouble stylists have become a staple of modern gun fu cinema, and are the signature shooting specialists of director John Woo and his admirers. Woo's Hong Kong noir films produced a distinctive "bullet ballet" featuring dual-pistol wielding gunfighters in highly choreographed fight scenes, combining physical artistry and finesse with gunplay – in stark contrast to the bulging muscles and fiery explosions of the One-Man Army stylists (pp. 32-33) of earlier action films.),_
