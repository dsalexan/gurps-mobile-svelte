// 
// 	Toxifier received minor changes to shortname () on Dread modifier, Rarity: Rare (Blessed Objects)
// 	Set Stone Golem armor #ChoiceList default() to Gauntlets Only to match Stone Fist damage description. _
// 		Added NOTE: on applying armor selection.
// 	Golem-Armor Swordsman: Corrected name. Added Golem-Armor plate suit (200 lbs.) as equipment with DR 0. _
// 		Removed Reduced Basic Move to get encumbered Move 2, Dodge 8. _

// 	Updated Partial Dice modifiers with new 12/24/2011 code for formula() tags
// 	Now that phoenix is able to display mode names of traits with a single mode in the attack tables, Racial Bite Attack _

// 		Frost Snake and Giant Rat

// 	Added No Physical Attack (2 Arms) as a taboo trait for Racial Punch Attack

<Exotic Physical>
// 	Racial Attack Features
// 
// 	These racial features create new 0-point Racial Attack advantages to replace the default attack attributes in the 
// 	combat table. They automatically figure in damage bonuses/penalties normally handled by the Brawling skill. They 
// 	should be used when the default attack attribute needs to be renamed or receive a modifier.
// 
// 	Renaming is accomplished by the shortname() tag being filled from user input, and used by phoenix.gcs in place of 
// 	the advantage name in the combat table entry.
// 	NOTE: This method of renaming is not supported by the basic charactersheet.gcs
// 
// 	A trait with a mode() tag having only one mode will display in the combat table as its trait name instead of its 
// 	mode name. For example, when removing both Kick & Punch modes from Brawling skill, the combat table entry reverts 
// 	to 'Brawling' instead of 'Brawling:Bite'. To put Bite back on the table, use the Racial Bite Attack feature.
// 
// 	NOTE: This default behavior may be changed by phoenix users. Go to Character Sheet Options | Sheet Profile.
// 	Select phoenix.gcs, then select Melee/Ranged Attacks Table Options. Change the 'Print attack mode names even for 
// 	attacks with only one mode?' option button to Yes under both melee and ranged Attacks Options sections.

It's virtually indestructible . . . and when the flesh golem is slain, the armor reanimates on its own as an “armor golem” and must be destroyed a second time. Fortunately for delvers, the vast weight of metal used (200 lbs.) makes the thing slow and clanking, and it seems to have the usual human vulnerabilities at the head and vitals. Usually carries an ordinary broadsword and a medium shield (DB 2), but these may be magical. The golem's massive armor can't be worn by a man, but is worth $1dx100 on its own as scrap!"),_
