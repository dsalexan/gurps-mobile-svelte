Description=2021 June 5. This file contains all of the equipment from the Basic Set and Fantasy converted to Metric weights,
		as well as converting certain attributes to Metric (e.g. Basic Lift). _
		All weights have been rounded off; those under 1 Kilo are rounded to two decimal places; those under 10 Kilos _
		are rounded to one decimal place; those over 10 Kilos are rounded to the nearest whole number. _
		Range (1/2D & Max) remains in yards, but the approximate conversion of 1 yard = 1 meter should suffice.
