Description=03/01/2016. This file contains all of the equipment from High-Tech Pulp Guns 1 converted to Metric weights. _
		All weights have been rounded off; those under 1 Kilo are rounded to two decimal places; those under 10 Kilos _
		are rounded to one decimal place; those over 10 Kilos are rounded to the nearest whole number. _
		Range (1/2D & Max) remains in yards, but the approximate conversion of 1 yard = 1 meter should suffice.
